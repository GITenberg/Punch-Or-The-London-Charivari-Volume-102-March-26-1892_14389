        partner. She addresses cheerful-looking</i> Middle-aged
        Gentleman, <i>who is standing near her.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>She.</i> I am not quite sure whether I gave you
        this waltz?</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> Nor I. But I hope you did. I am afraid it
            is nearly over, but we shall still have time for a
            turn. [<i>They join the dancers.</i></p>

            <p><i>She.</i> Too many people here to-night to make
            waltzing pleasant.</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> Yes, it is rather crowded. Shall we sit
            out?</p>

            <p><i>She</i> (<i>thankfully, as he has not quite her
            step.</i>) If you like. And see, the band is bringing
            things to a conclusion. Don't you hate a <i>cornet</i>
            in so small a room as this? So dreadfully loud, you
            know.</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> Quite. Yes, I think it would have been
            better to have kept to the piano and the strings.</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> But the place is prettily decorated. It
            must have cost them a lot, getting all these
            flowers.</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> I daresay. No doubt they managed it by
            contract. And lots of things come from Algeria
            nowadays. You can get early vegetables in winter for
            next to nothing.</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> Yes, isn't it lovely? All these palms, I
            suppose, came from the Stores.</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> No doubt. By the way, do you know the
            people of the house at all?</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> Not much. Fact was, I was brought.
            Couldn't find either the host or hostess. Such a crowd
            on the staircase, you know.</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> Yes. Rather silly asking double the
            number of people the rooms will hold, isn't it?</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> Awfully. However, I suppose it pleases
            some folks. I presume they consider it the swagger
            thing to do?</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> I suppose they do. Do you know many
            people here?</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> Not a soul, or&mdash;</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> You would not have spoken to me?</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> Well, no&mdash;not exactly that.
            But&mdash;</p>
            <p><i>He.</i> You have no better excuse ready.
            Quite.</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> How rude you are! You know I didn't
            quite mean that.</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> No, not quite. Quite.</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> By the way, do you know what time it
            is?</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> Well, from the rooms getting less
            crowded, I fancy it must be the supper hour. May I not
            take you down?</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> You are most kind! But do you know the
            way?</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> I think so. You see, I have learned the
            geography of the place fairly well.</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> How fortunate! But if I accept your
            kindness, I think I should have the honour of knowing
            your name.</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> Certainly; my name is SMITH.</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> Any relation of the people who are
            giving the dance?</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> Well, yes. I am giving the dance
            myself&mdash;or rather, my wife is.</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> Oh, this is quite too delightful! For
            now you can tell me what to avoid.</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> Certainly; and I have the pleasure of
            speaking to&mdash;?</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> You must ask my <i>chaperon</i> for my
            name. You know, introductions are not the fashion.</p>

            <p><i>He.</i> And your <i>chaperon</i> is&mdash;?</p>

            <p><i>She.</i> Somewhere or other. In the meanwhile, if
            you will allow me?</p>

            <p>So his Old Pilot got the sack.</p>

            <p>Nay more, one day, in a fierce squall,</p>

            <p>With Wilful WILHELM, who preferred</p>

    <p>WHAT THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, MR. PUNCH, SAYS TO THE ARTISTS'
    CORPS.&mdash;"Gentlemen, you would no doubt like a brush with
    the enemy, to whom you will always show a full face. Any
    colourable pretence for a skirmish won't suit your palette. You
    march with the colours, and, like the oils, you will never
    run.' You all look perfect pictures, and everybody must admire
    your well-knit frames. Gentlemen, I do not know whether you
    will take my concluding observation as a compliment or not, but
    I need hardly say that it is meant to be both truthful and
    complimentary, and it is this, that though you are all Artists,
    you look perfect models,"</p>

    <h2>PONSCH, PRINCE OF OLLENDORF.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>M. Maeterlinck's very last Masterpiece.</i>)</h4>

    <p>The Belgian Master has tried, as he has already informed the
    world, "to write SHAKSPEARE for a company of Marionnettes."
    Encouraged by his extraordinary success, he has soared higher
    yet, and adapted our greatest national drama for the purposes
    of the (Independent) itinerant Stage. We are enabled by the
    courtesy of his publishers to give a few specimen scenes from
    this <i>magnum opus</i>, which, as will be seen, requires
    somewhat more elaborate mounting and mechanical effects than
    are at present afforded by the ordinary Punch Show. In M.
    MAETERLINCK's version, <i>Ponsch</i> becomes the Prince of
    Half-seas-over-Holland; he is the victim of hereditary
    homicidal mania, complicated by neurotic hysteria. Inflamed by
    the insinuations of <i>Mynheer Olenikke</i>&mdash;a kind of
    Dutch <i>Mephistopheles</i> and <i>Iago</i> combined&mdash;he
    is secretly jealous of his consort the <i>Princess Jödi's</i>
    preference for the society of <i>Djoë</i>, the Court Jester and
    Society Clown. Here is our first sample:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>A Chamber in the Castle.</i> Princess JÖDI
        <i>discovered at a window with</i> DJOË.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
            <p><i>Jödi</i>. Lo! lo! a shower of stars is falling
            upon the fowl-house!</p>

            <p><i>Djoë</i>. Oh! oh! a shower of stars upon the
            fowl-house? (<i>A water pipe in the back-garden bursts
            suddenly and splashes them.</i>) Ah! ah! I am wet all
            over! Have you a pocket handkerchief?</p>

            <p><i>Jödi</i>. Oh, look! a comet&mdash;an enormous
            one&mdash;has descended into the water-butt! The sky is
            blood-red, and the moon has turned the colour of green
            cheese. This bodes some disaster!</p>

            <p><i>Djoë</i>. It is
            unsettled&mdash;rainy&mdash;unpleasant weather. Can you
            lend me an umbrella?</p>

            <p><i>Jödi</i>. I cannot lend you an umbrella, because
            I have lent mine to the gardener's wife. Owls are
            roosting on the chimney-pots, and a stickleback has
            jumped out of the pond. Hush, my Lord the Prince
            approaches!</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[Prince PONSCH <i>enters, bearing a stout staff, which
        he nurses gloomily, like an infant; a hurricane is heard in
        the middle distance; the waterpipe sobs strangely and then
        expires; a blackbeetle comes out of a cupboard and runs
        uneasily about, until a flash of lightning enters down the
        chimney and kills it.</i> PONSCH <i>stands glaring at</i>
        DJOË <i>and the</i> Princess.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
            <p><i>Djoë</i> (<i>hastily</i>). There is going to be a
            storm. Do not forget what I have uttered. Good

    <div class="drama">
            <p><i>Jödi</i> (<i>nervously</i>). What an appalling
            evening! I have never seen the like of such a sky.</p>

            <p><i>Ponsch</i>. There is something about you this
            evening&mdash;how beautiful you are looking! Bring
            BEBBI-PONSCH.</p>

            <p><i>Jödi</i> (<i>fetching the Infant Prince</i>).
            Here he is. Why do you look so strangely at him?</p>

            <p><i>Bebbi-Ponsch</i> (<i>a small, but important

            no mo-ore?</p>

            <p><i>Ponsch</i>. The soul of a little stage-child
            looms from under his green eyes! OLENIKKE was right,
            and I&mdash; No matter. I will open the window.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Opens it, and throws</i> BEBBI-P. <i>out. Sound of
        water-splash audible.</i></p>

    <div class="drama">
            <p><i>Jödi</i>. Oh my! Oh my! What have you done? He
            has fallen right into the moat&mdash;on one of the
            swans!</p>

            <p><i>Ponsch</i>. Indeed&mdash;on one of the swans?
            (<i>A pot of mignonnette is blown off the window-sill
            by a gust.</i>) I will close the window. (<i>Closes it;
            a hailstorm beats on the panes.</i>) Is that really a
            hailstorm&mdash;or only birds?</p>

            <p><i>Jödi</i>. I can hear nothing. (P. <i>strikes her
            suddenly on the head with staff.</i>) Someone is
            knocking at my door. Come in! I cannot see anything
            now.</p>

            <p><i>Ponsch</i>. Can you, indeed, see nothing? [<i>He
            strikes her again.</i></p>

            <p><i>Jödi</i>. Now I can see stars. I feel as if
            purple mills were going round in my head. I shall never
            kiss anybody any more. Oh! oh! oh! [<i>She
            dies.</i></p>

            <p><i>Ponsch</i>. She was a beautiful woman, do you
            know? Oh, how lonely I shall feel hereafter! (<i>A
            black dog is heard scratching and sniffing outside the
            door.</i>) It is only Tobbi. Someone has trod on your
            toe, my poor Tobbi. Come in. Give me your paw.
            (<i>Tobbi enters, and flies suddenly at his nose.</i>)
            Oh, my nose is bleeding! Let us go to the pond. I do
            not know why I feel so melancholy this evening. [<i>He

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>One of the Baron's Assistant Readers has been reading a
    really interesting, well written novel in two volumes, by MARY
    BRADFORD-WHITING. It is called <i>Denis O'Neil</i>, and tells
    of the adventures of a young Irish Doctor who gets entangled in
    the plots of one of those Secret Societies that used to exist
    in "the most distressful country that ever yet was seen," some
    twenty years ago. The romance contains some clever sketches of
    character. The story (published by BENTLEY) ends sadly, and
    those who want to find fault with it will say it is too
    short.</p>

    <p>The Leadenhall Press,&mdash;immortalised by its invention of
    that invaluable work of art, "The Hairless Author's Paper Pad,"
    which the Baron herewith and hereby strongly recommends to Mr.
    GLADSTONE, who has so much writing to do with a pad on his
    knee, and for this purpose Mr. G. would find this the "<i>knee
    plus ultra</i>" of inventions,&mdash;this same Leadenhall Press
    has recently published a story without a title, offering a
    reward of £100 to any individual, or to be divided between such
    individuals, as may guess it. The story is in effect about a
    youth who lost his right eye in fighting another boy, and who
    subsequently revenged himself by depriving his antagonist of an
    eye by a violent stroke at Lawn-tennis. What can be the title?
    The Baron has had the following suggestions made to
    him:&mdash;"Eye for an Eye," "The Egotist," "My Eye!" "Aye!
    aye!" "Ocular Demonstration," "A Man of One Eye-dear!" "Eyes
    Righted," "One Left," "The Other Eye," "Two Pupils and One
    Eye," "You and Eye," "The Eyes Have It." The Baron "winks the
    other eye," and will be very glad should any hint of his have
    assisted a deserving person to gain the reward offered by Mr.
    TUER. <i>En attendant</i> the Baron has hit upon a still more
    novel idea. He will write some contributions towards short
    stories, and his readers shall finish them. The terms will be
    these:&mdash;The Baron commences a chapter, or a few lines of
    it, and leaves it unfinished, then his readers shall finish the
    sentence, and sometimes the chapter, for themselves. If the
    sentence, or the chapter, as the case may be, <i>shall turn out
    to be exactly what the Baron would have written had he
    continued it, then he, the Baron, will award</i> £100 <i>to the
    successful candidate, or will award a division of that sum
    among the successful candidates. Every competitor shall pay the
    Baron</i> £50. <i>And to insure such payment, each competitor's
    cheque for this amount must accompany his or her
    contribution.</i></p>

    <p>EXAMPLE.&mdash;<i>CHAPTER I.&mdash;The harvest-moon was
    slowly rising. The heather, dried and burnt by the mid-day sun,
    appeared, to the eye unaccustomed to this aspect of the
    country, to be merely a rugged divergence from the main road.
    Descending carefully from his dog-cart, a small man in a big
    coat, muffled up to the eyes, proceeded leisurely
    to&mdash;</i></p>

    <p>Now, then, <i>what</i> did he leisurely proceed to do?

    <h2>"MY DEAR EYES! WHAT! SEE-USAN!"</h2>

    <p>At the Prince of Wales's, Mr. ARTHUR ROBERTS, as <i>Captain
    Crosstree</i>, is more ARTHUR ROBERTS than ever, and,
    consequently, immensely droll. While he is on the stage, the
    audience is convulsed with spasmodic laughter, excepting when
    he tries to forget himself and his drollery in a loyal attempt
    at doing justice to Messrs. SIMS' AND PETTITT's words, and to
    the serious business of some situation intended to be dramatic.
    At such moments the laughter of the House is checked, a sudden
    gloom comes over the faces that were but now on the broad grin,
    even the lineaments of Mr. ROBERTS become agonised, and the
    audience, like <i>Christopher Sly</i> when bored by the Duke's
    players, mutter to themselves, "would t'were done." But these
    painful seconds, which, at the time, seem hours, are, we are
    glad to say, but brief and passing shadows over Mr. ROBERTS'
    own quaint humour which speedily reasserts itself, and, the
    Pettitt-and-Sims fetters being cast aside, the People's ARTHUR
    is himself again, and more so than ever. And, when he <i>is</i>
    himself, he is simply the most absurd person that ever faced
    the footlights.</p>

    <p>Miss NELLIE STEWART is a pretty singing, dancing, twisting,
    twirling <i>Susan</i>. But what induced handsome Miss MARION
    BURTON, once so gay and sprightly as <i>Cherubino</i> in <i>Le
    Nozze di Figaro</i>, to essay this musically dreary part of
    <i>William</i>, and, further, to wear a costume about as unlike
    that of the nautical and traditional <i>William</i> as can well
    be imagined, is a puzzle to anyone who knows what she
    <i>has</i> done and <i>can</i> do. Not a bit of dash in the
    character; all the good old conventional British Tar taken
    right out of it. She can indeed say with the fool in <i>The
    Yeomen of the Guard</i>, "I've got a song to sing, oh!" for she
    has two or three, but her "voice is wasted on the desert air,"
    as they go for nothing, and therefore probably nobody else
    could make them go for anything.</p>

    <p>Mr. ARTHUR WILLIAMS is funny, but his Variety Show scene,
    with soliloquy and song, is too long; or rather, it would not
    be too long, if the piece were only cut down to a two hours'
    entertainment.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Let this "Comic Opera," for so is it described in the bills,
    be cut down as ruthlessly, but not as blindly, as
    <i>William</i> cut down <i>Crosstree</i>; let something
    catching be substituted for most of the music of the First
    Act,&mdash;specially omitting the "Why, certainly!"
    interpolation, which is a feeble but evident imitation of Mr.
    W.S. GILBERT's classic "What, never?" "Well, hardly ever;" let
    the music of the Second Act be taken out by handfuls, and, if
    possible, let what remains be replaced by something sparkling;
    then, with less of sweet but sad <i>William</i>&mdash;for the
    present version of the part is quite "BURTON's <i>Anatomy of
    Melancholy</i>,"&mdash;with less of fascinating but squirming
    <i>Susan</i>, far less of minor characters generally, and more,
    by comparison, of the two MACS&mdash;meaning the two ARTHURS
    with the plural names ROBERTS and WILLIAMS,&mdash;also a
    telling song for Mr. CHAUNCEY OLCOTT (whose singing now wins an
    <i>encore</i> for an indifferent ballad),&mdash;with the
    Captain's-giggy hornpipe of Mr. WILLIE WARD retained, as also
    the graceful dancing of Miss KATIE SEYMOUR, and then, omitting
    as much of the plot and authors' written dialogue as can be
    conveniently spared,&mdash;very little of it would be
    missed,&mdash;there is no rhyme or reason why <i>Blue-Eyed
    Susan</i> should not run on as a Variety Entertainment for any
    number of nights and days, during which fresh material can be
    constantly substituted by Messrs. ROBERTS &amp; Co. of the
    Drollery Company, Unlimited, without racking the fertile brains
    of Messrs. PETTITT AND SIMS.</p>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March</i> 14.&mdash;JACKSON
    turned up to-night answering questions from Irish Members. This
    reminds us he's Irish Secretary. Been so of course since
    Parliament met; but quite forgotten it. Mention this to the
    SPEAKER who looked a little dull while Captain PRICE was
    discoursing on Navy Affairs in Committee of Supply. So went up
    to have a little chat with him in the Chair.</p>

    <p>"My dear TOBY," he said, "I don't know whether you meant it,
    but you've paid JACKSON the highest compliment it is possible
    to convey. When in these times the CHIEF SECRETARY so manages
    to conduct business of his department that he himself is
    temporarily forgotten, he's doing it surpassingly well. My big
    brother ROBERT was once Chief Secretary, though perhaps you
    forget that also. He resigned because, as he said, there was
    not enough work to keep an active man going. That was long time
    ago. I daresay you had no chance of forgetting during the last
    five years that Prince ARTHUR was Chief Secretary?"</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:22%;">
        <a href="images/155-3.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/155-3.png"
             alt="T.P. Gill." /></a>T.P. Gill.
    </div>

    <p>Cannot claim to have invented the compliment the SPEAKER
    discerned; merely mentioning matter of fact; but, as he says,
    when in these days a Chief Secretary manages to get himself
    forgotten, the wheels at the Irish Office must be going pretty
    smoothly. JACKSON has not brought about this miraculous change
    by laying himself out to flatter or court Irish Members. He is
    exactly the same as he was when he filled office of Financial
    Secretary; doubtless the same as when he looked after his
    tanyard in Yorkshire. Goes straight to the point in simple
    unaffected business manner that ruffles no sensibilities. Fancy
    he could tan a hide in such a way that it would not feel any
    resentment.</p>

    <p>A predecessor at the Irish Office who succeeded, in more
    troublesome times, in living on peaceable terms with Irish
    Members, was CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN. Irish Members, swift judges of
    character, taking measure of both, came to conclusion nothing
    to be gained by rowing round them. What killed FORSTER, and
    turned GEORGE TREVELYAN's hair grey, made CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN
    smile&mdash;not an offensive smile, but one of interested
    amusement. JACKSON's sense of humour not so keen, but his
    imperturbability even more impregnable. If Irish Member trailed
    his coat before him, JACKSON would say, "My dear fellow, won't
    you get cold? Let me help you on with your coat."</p>

    <p>SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, a judge on this particular point, says
    the MARKISS missed the greatest chance he has had for six
    months in not putting JACKSON in place of OLD MORALITY.</p>

    <p>"Precious good thing for us, TOBY," says the SQUIRE, "that
    he didn't. JACKSON the very model
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"
       id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span> of a Leader of House, and
       Prince ARTHUR&mdash;well he's Prince ARTHUR."</p>

    <p>"But I suppose you don't mean," I venture to ask, "that
    JACKSON is the exclusive type of a successful Leader?"</p>

    <p>"No," says the SQUIRE, with a far-away look.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Two Votes in Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Spent doleful afternoon in Committee
    of Supply. Circumstances call upon Members below Gangway,
    Radicals or Irishmen, to come to front, and make at least show
    of doing something. SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE pricks up his
    ears when Chairman puts question to allow £6 7<i>s.</i>
    11<i>d.</i> on account of Sheerness Police Court. Why should
    Northampton contribute its quota, however small, to expenses of
    Sheerness Police Court? Debate and Division; after which, the
    SAGE retired to smoke cigarette through rest of afternoon, and
    discuss probable date of Dissolution.</p>

    <p>Then Irish Members come on. Cream seems spooned off the mass
    in preparation for festivities on St. Patrick's Day, and only
    the skimmest of skim milk left. WEBB wobbles to the front;
    talks out vote for Chicago Royal Committee, although
    ATTORNEY-GENERAL tells him it will be all right as to Irish
    interests; being now close upon ten minutes to seven, when
    Committee must adjourn, WEBSTER hasn't time to make detailed
    explanations, but promises to do so on Report. WEBB maunders on
    all the same, and Vote postponed.</p>

    <p>Great day for FLYNN. TIM HEALY thinks he's pretty smart as a
    debater; SEXTON believes he knows a thing or two; O'BRIEN is
    understood to be something of an orator. FLYNN will show House
    how all these qualities may be combined in one man. Does it by
    the tiresome twenty minutes, the lamentable half-hour; popping
    up on every question with comically judicial air; talking on
    with fatal feeble flatulent fluency, whilst GILL sits nursing
    his hat awaiting his turn.</p>

    <p>Alack for Irish humour, eloquence and deviltry, that it
    should come to this!</p>

    <p>Whilst FLYNN once again turns on the tap of his tepid
    dish-water, news comes that Lord HAMPDEN died this morning in
    far-off Pau. HAMPDEN was the BRAND who sat in Chair during
    Parliament of 1874, and wrestled nightly with the "bhoys" when
    they were in their prime&mdash;MAJOR O'GORMAN rollicking
    through the night; JOSEPH GILLIS with lean hand outstretched
    and his "It seems to me, MR. SPEAKER"; PARNELL in the white
    heat of passion; DELAHUNTY with his One Pound Notes, and poor
    MCCARTHY DOWNING with his scared look and his indescribable but
    unmistakable air of one accustomed to frequent the best society
    in Skibbereen.</p>

    <p>After a fourth speech from FLYNN, with another to follow
    from WEBB, one almost envies the EX-SPEAKER lying at rest at
    the foot of the Pyrenees.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;A few Votes in Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;St. Patrick's Day in the evening.
    Irish Members rose to occasion; indeed, at one time O'KELLY and
    JOHN O'CONNOR rose together; remained on their legs in defiance
    of Standing Orders and angry protest of Chairman. Seemed as if
    someone must be suspended <i>pour encourager les autres</i>.
    Storm suddenly stilled; rising passion subdued by appearance of
    ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS on the scene, wanting to know about the
    Refreshment-bar in the Lobby. which, he said, was lowering to
    the dignity and respectability of House.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i> 12·15 A.M.&mdash;All this in Committee of
    Supply, which came to end at midnight. Then Report of Supply
    brought on; uproar renewed; Vote for Irish Teachers' Pension
    Fund under discussion. Irish Members mysteriously disappeared;
    SEXTON, understood to have ready prodigious speech on the
    subject, nowhere to be found. "JOHN O'CONNOR," NOLAN hoarsely
    whispered, "you have the longest legs in the Party; go and look
    up the bhoys, and I'll talk."</p>

    <p>Silently but swiftly LONG JOHN stole forth on his mission;
    NOLAN nobly performed his part. At end of forty minutes'
    breathless talk, the Colonel, feeling his mouth growing
    parched, moved adjournment of House. SPEAKER didn't recognise
    relevancy of argument; declined to put the question.</p>

    <p>"The Hon. Member," he said, "has spoken for forty minutes,
    and not given a single reason in favour of his proposal."</p>

    <p>"I was coming to that point," said NOLAN, "and, if it is
    quite in order, I will now approach it."</p>

    <p>Ruled out of order. LONG JOHN, back from his foray, in
    course of which had hunted up SEXTON, threw himself into
    breach; moved the adjournment for irresistible reason.</p>

    <p>"I object," he said, "to this important subject being dealt
    with at nearly one o'clock in the morning on St. Patrick's
    night."</p>

    <p>T.W. RUSSELL, condoled with his compatriots below Gangway on
    difficulties of situation. "Certainly hard," he said, "that on
    St. Patrick's night they should be called upon to discuss
    questions involving facts and figures." BALFOUR opposed
    adjournment; CONYBEARE strode in; commenced what promised to be
    long speech; Prince ARTHUR moved Closure; carried by nearly a
    hundred majority.</p>

    <p>1·35 A.M.&mdash;House just back after division on question
    of adjournment; Ministerialists in full muster and full of
    fight; 41 for adjournment, 121 against. As if nothing been said
    during previous hour-and-half, ILLINGWORTH urges Prince ARTHUR
    to concede adjournment; PRINCE ARTHUR rises to reply. Irish
    Members, pulling themselves together, walk steadily out, amid
    ribald laughter from Ministerialists. Once more the CURSE OF
    CAMBOURNE turns up. This seems, quite naturally, to suggest the
    Closure; sort of automatic procedure; CONYBEARE&mdash;Closure.
    One more division just to wind up, and at ten minutes past two
    Vote carried and House up.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Revival of old times.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>, 1·20 A.M.&mdash;House just up, after
    prolonged wrangle, lasting, with interval for dinner, straight
    through from two o'clock yesterday afternoon. Met then for
    Morning Sitting designed to make progress with financial
    business. For four hours disputed how business was to be
    arranged. This left one hour for doing it. Sitting suspended at
    seven, resumed at nine.</p>

    <p>At it again talking about Royalties on Gold in Wales.
    Domestic Policy in Zululand, the Irish Question in the Falkland
    Islands, and Parliamentary Reporting. All this led gently up to
    passing Vote on Account; a conclusion finally arrived at with
    the assistance of the Closure.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
